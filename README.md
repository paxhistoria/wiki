# üåê Welcome to the Pax Historia Wiki

## Game Overview:

Pax Historia is a sandbox roleplaying game available on [our website](https://www.paxhistoria.co). You choose a starting situation (called a 'preset'), then select which country you would like to play as.

## Unique Features

* **Chat** at the beginning of each turn to coordinate with (or mislead!) other countries.
* **Freedom** in what 3 actions you take during your turn. Describe any policy, make an announcement, move your battalions, support a separatist movement in your enemy's country - you can do practically anything.&#x20;
* **Your advisor is always available** to offer advice or answer questions about how the game works.
* **Marketplace of user-generated presets** with diverse maps, countries, and alt history starting points.
* **Exciting conflict mechanics** like getting to send out distress messages to other countries begging for help if you get attacked!
* **Easy gameplay** with features like our Defense Minister which removes the need to tediously align your troops along domestic borders.
