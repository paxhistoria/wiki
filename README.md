Play the 20th century large scale warfare experience, send the Zimmerman Telegraph, ship off Lenin, launch Operation Sealion, experience the endless schemes and realpolitik of Bismarck's Era, conquer and achieve glory in the middle ages of a medieval Europe, sacrifice tribute as the Aztecs, fight over Jing Province, or trick other factions into doing your dirty work.&#x20;
