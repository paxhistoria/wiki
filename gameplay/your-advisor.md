# ðŸ§  Your Advisor

The Advisor is there to make life easier for you as a player. It is away of the game-state/world stage of the game you're in, and will be advising you. Ask it for help, or advice, or tell it your ultimate goal, and it will return with potential actions or chats you should take, depending on what your goal is.
