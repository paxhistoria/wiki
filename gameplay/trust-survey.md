# ⚖️ Trust Survey

In essence, this threat survey, determined by A.I. will determine how the defense minister, and diplomats will behave. \
Also, their trust will be their tendency to believe your promises, or fall for your schemes.\
\
Factions that trust you more will find less need to leave troops on your border with them, they are your allies. They will also try to assist you in chat with any requests you might have. \
\
Since this is sandbox, you can betray them if you want and take advantage if they trusted you, but this will lower the trust every other nation has of you, and good luck with diplomacy then.\
\
Nation's that don't trust you will probably never do what they think you want them to do. But you can always reverse psychology them. Who knows.\
