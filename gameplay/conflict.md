# ⚠️ Conflict

Conflict works very simply, there is only two options, Attacking or Defending.\
\
When an action that is to movetroops to attack a region is executed, it will take a specific number of turns before the battle begins depending on how far away the region is. \
\
Every detail regarding a battle is premade during action planning, and when it is made, the troops depart. \
This emulates historical battles far more realistically, blunders and incompetent officers will reflect in battles as you, a high ranking minister, clearly won't be able to make sure every division and army is attacking and retreating at perfect times. You just gotta give the order and pray.\
\
This game doesn't have a player function for defending the regions owned by the faction you play as. \
\
Defense of your own regions are handled by a defense minister also powered by an A.I. \
It will behave based on your input, but also its own ideas. \
\
One of the reasons Pax Historia chooses to not make defending your own regions a mechanic is because the focus is external politics. \
However, the MAIN reason is to leave room for other factions to scheme against a player nation. \
\
For example, players aware of the history will never be able to get sneak attacked or fall for schemes in historical timelines because they most likely already know the truth. Such as Germany in WW2's surprise attack on Russia. The element of surprise was quite important in that war, however, it's not do-able when the player can leave the entire army on the border because they already know the Germans will betray them. If the internal troops are managed by a defense minister, harder for the player to persuade, and more influenced by the situation on the world stage, there is room for schemes to occur to players.
