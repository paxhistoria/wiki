# ⚠️ Conflict

Region changes are currently the only form of results of conflicts, and exact conflicts don't take place because of the turn based game structure.

When regions are transferred, there is UI for conflict results. But the conflict itself has no mechanic or stage, the A.I. will determine whether or not one of your actions will result in a region transfer. For example: "Attack New York" May or may not yield the conquest of that region/regions in that area.
