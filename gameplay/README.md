The gist of things is to experience history in a more surreal way. Pax Historia's nation's that are not players are managed by actual Artificial Intelligence, like Claude or GPT. With this, diplomacy can be simulated, you can scheme and chat, and make guidelines for specific factions. Games can now be whatever you want them to be, and chances are, the A.I. will succeed in simulating the actual being.\
\
Once a game is launched/started, the screen resembles this:\
\
Notifications is a small tab that includes a list of events you should be aware of, and also where to plan actions.\
\
The game is a turn by turn timeline system, each turn being 1 month. Notifications is like a checklist of all the things you must complete before ending a turn.
