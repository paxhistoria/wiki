# üñãÔ∏è Creating Actions

In the Game, each turn is as much time as you choose. Every round, you as a nation can take as many actions as you want. Try not to make decisions that will be too insignificant to matter, but also, avoid make decisions so drastic they will cause instability. But don't worry too much about it, the point is, be a good leader.

Of course, you can change anything you want by however much you want, but careful, changing too much might cause economic or political instability. Those setbacks will reflect since these details are all managed by A.I. (Note, as of now, there is no statistic for economics or stability, but the A.I. will note if your actions might cause instability, which increases your chance of collapse)

TLDR: At the end of the day, you can do whatever you want.
