# üñãÔ∏è Creating Actions

In the Game, each turn is 1 month of time. Every month, you as a nation can only take three actions, so pick carefully. Don't make decisions that will be too insignificant to matter, but also, don't make decisions so drastic they will cause instability.

\
In this game, there are 5 ways to manage and run a faction. They are simply:\
\
Announcements, Changing National Policy, Moving Troops to Attack or Defend, Establishing Subject Factions, and of course, Chatting with other factions!\
\
In summary: \
Announcements are declarations you wish to make clear to the other factions. \
\
Changing National Policy is lowering taxes, increasing demand for military, changing trade deal policy. Anything demographic or economic.&#x20;

Of course, you can change anything you want by however much you want, but careful, changing too much might cause economic or political instability. Those setbacks will reflect since these details are all managed by A.I.\
\
Moving Troops would be attacking the regions of foreign nations, when attacking a foreign nation, there are many variables you should be aware of, which I will document:\
Destination, Amount of Troops, Retreat Threshhold, Source Location, Goal.\
\
&#x20;  Destination:\
The location that the troops you send will be moving towards. This would normally be a region on the map.\
\
&#x20;  Amount of Troops:\
This is simple the amount of troops you will send, in the game it is expressed as a percent of your total army size.\
\
&#x20;  Retreat Threshhold:\
This is the amount of troops that will experience casualties before the rest of the army force routes and retreats. \
\
For example, if you send 1,000,000 troops, and the threshhold is 50, then the army of 1,000,000 will retreat when 500,000 of them become casualties. \
Unless of course you send more reinforcements.\
\
&#x20;  Source Location:\
Source Location is the region from which the troops will be moving. Distance matters in the game so moving troops from Antarctica to Greenland would take multiple months, whereas Germany to France would be less than one. This can be a region on the map, or a faction name.\


&#x20;  Goal:\
When moving troops they will always be of the three Goals, Attacking, Defending, or to Quell Unrest in Puppet nations. \
\- Attacking would sending troops to try and conquer a region.\
\- Defending would be sending troops to defend a region. (Since the game is meant to simulate the feeling of being in the government of factions in history, rather than simulating some all-knowing omni-chancellor who has complete control over everything, defending your faction's own regions isn't a mechanic, that will be handled by a defense minister. You can only defend the regions owned by other factions) Beyond that, you may only defend them when they are being attacked or are going to be attacked.\
\- QuellUnrest is simply trying to put down a possible rebellion in puppet countries.\
\
Establishing Subjects:\
This is the basic act of granting minor autonomy to a nation for whatever purpose.\
\
Chatting with other factions:\
This is going to be where you can ask anything from any foreign nation, and tell them whatever you want and expect unique responses each time, since it, along with all the other statistics, are managed by A.I. Agents.
