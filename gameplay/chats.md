# ðŸŽ© Chats

Yeah, that's right. No more limiting pre-made diplomacy tabs in history games. Now, you can just ask for whatever the heck you want from a nation, and immediately get to the cheese of what you must do in return for whatever it is you are asking for. Or, to engage in a fruitful debate over the direction of a faction or a detail. Complete Sandbox, whatever you want!\

Often, A.I. will also chat with other A.I. to come to decisions, but also so there are archives of discussions between other nations, that one day you may be able to uncover through intelligence agencies, and use as blackmail or justification for war, or anything.
