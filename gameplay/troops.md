# ðŸ‘² Troops

In this game, there are battalions/armies represented by circular markers, they do not technically serve any in game purpose, but the A.I. is aware of their existence. You can move them specifically, or you can simply order conquests and the A.I. will simulate the movement of battalions for you.\
\
In other words, they are a mechanic that exists but not one you should worry too much about.
