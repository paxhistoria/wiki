# ðŸŽ¤ Next Speaker

The AI has to determine which nation should speak next in a chat with several nations. If this section is left empty, the chat stage will choose the "next speaker" randomly. This is because in the chat stage, only one nation can speak at a time.

Note: For all prompts, don't worry about telling it a structure to output, you can simply tell the AI how you want it to behave.
