### Core Statistics

<table><thead><tr><th width="59.58154296875">Icon</th><th>Statistic</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>💸</td><td><strong>GDP Per Capita</strong></td><td>The total economic output of a country divided by its population. Represents the economic strength of your nation on an individual level. Currency is 2020 USD. Cannot be edited for a country, it is based on the regions that a country owns.</td></tr><tr><td>🧑</td><td><strong>Core Population</strong></td><td>The total number of tax payers. Represents the population that contributes to your economy through taxation. Again, cannot be edited for a country because it is based on which regions it owns.</td></tr><tr><td>💰</td><td><strong>Government Coffers</strong></td><td>The total financial reserves available to the government. Represents your national treasury for funding initiatives. Again, in 2020 USD.</td></tr><tr><td>💳</td><td><strong>Tax Rate</strong></td><td>The percentage of income that is paid to the government per person. Higher rates generate more revenue but may impact stability. This is paid out per month, so a 12% tax with a GDP per capita of $100 per year means you collect $1 in tax per active population per month (12/12 = 1). </td></tr><tr><td>🪖</td><td><strong>Defending Troops</strong></td><td>The total number of active defending personnel. Represents your standing military force.</td></tr><tr><td>➕</td><td><strong>Defending Troops Set Point</strong></td><td>The number of defending troops. Shown as a number but stored as a ratio that determines how your military scales with population.</td></tr><tr><td>⚔️</td><td><strong>Military Efficiency</strong></td><td>The strength and strategic might of your military. Represents the quality and effectiveness of your armed forces. Between 1-100.</td></tr><tr><td>🔥</td><td><strong>Rebellion Meter</strong></td><td>Percent chance of a revolt at game start, run each round. Higher values indicate greater internal instability.</td></tr></tbody></table>
