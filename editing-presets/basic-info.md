# ℹ️ Basic Info

The top of the page when you click a preset includes basic information like the background image/gif, the title/name, the round played, ext.

Right below that on the left side is a log of version histories and a button to edit the preset.

If you want to edit an existing preset, simply click edit the preset. If its a preset you don't own, you will be prompted to make a copy of the preset.

After doing this, you can change the following:

The Description, a simple passage if you want to describe the preset, this will only be visible to other players who might stumble across and play your preset.

The "World before Round 1" section will be shown to the A.I. in the actual game. It essentially describes the context for the game before the first round. This is here in case you want to create a preset for a alt-historical timeline or parallel universe world, where history happened differently. Perhaps a "what if Germany won WW1", ext.

After that section, you can change the map and create countries/factions. Here, you can really make whatever you want, perhaps the factions in the "countries" section could be warlords of fantasy characters, depending on what kind of preset you want to make.

Note: The Paint section is a tool to make it easier to edit the map for large countries.

At the very bottom are the prompts, more info on that will be in the AI Prompts section of this wiki.
