# Default Prompts

## What are default prompts?

Prompts + AI model combination that Pax Historia automatically updates, so your preset can become more reliable and fun over time.

## When do default prompts update?

* Any time Pax Historia updates the default prompts, any games going forward made with a preset using default prompts will be updated.
* In the future: when making a game into a preset, we will ask if you would like to update the prompts used during your game to the latest default prompts.

## Will prompts being used change in the middle of a game?

No, once a game with default prompts has been created that game's prompts will remain the same - even if the default prompts are updated.

## When to use default prompts?

Instead of having to constantly fine-tune prompts or even understand how they work, you can just focus on either editing only the prompts you want to change, or even none at all.&#x20;

Our goal is to give preset creators easy control by editing starting events, statistics, and conditional events without worrying about prompts.
